# Practical-Machine-Learning-Course-Project
The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which the test set of http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har did the exercise.

## Synopsis
A random forest and gradient boosting machine models were trained and accuracy scores on a validation set were compared. The random forest had 99.36% and the gbm had 95.82% accuracy rates; thus the random forest was chosen as the champion model for the test set. The accuracy of the model on the test set was 100%.
